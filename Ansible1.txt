Introduction To Ad-Hoc Commands

An ad-hoc command is something that you might type in to do something really quick, but don’t want to save for later.

For instance, if you wanted to power off all of your lab for Christmas vacation, you could execute a quick one-liner in Ansible without writing a playbook.


1: Let’s use Ansible’s command line tool to reboot all web servers in Atlanta, 10 at a time

run the command on all servers in a group, in this case, atlanta, in 10 parallel forks:

ansible atlanta -a "/sbin/reboot" -f 10



2: If you want to run commands as a different user, it looks like this:

ansible atlanta -a "touch file1" -u user1

ansible atlanta -a "mkdir file2" -u user1



3: File Transfer

ansible atlanta -m copy -a "src=/etc/hosts dest=/tmp/hosts"



4: The file module allows changing ownership and permissions on files. These same options can be passed directly to the copy module as well:

 ansible atlanta  -m file -a "dest=/tmp/hosts mode=777 owner=user1 group=user1"


5: The file module can also create directories, similar to mkdir -p:

ansible atlanta   -m file -a "dest=/tmp/testfolder mode=755 owner=user1  group=user1  state=directory"



6: As well as delete directories (recursively) and delete files:

ansible atlanta  -m file -a "dest=/tmp/testfolder state=absent"


7: Managing Packages

There are modules available for yum and apt. 

7.1 - Ensure a package is installed, but don’t update it:

 ansible atlanta -m yum -a "name=git state=present"

7.2 - Ensure a package is installed to a specific version:

 ansible atlanta -m yum -a "name=vim-2.4 state=present"

7.3 Ensure a package is at the latest version:

ansible atlanta  -m yum -a "name=git state=latest"


7.5  Ensure a package is not installed:

ansible atlanta   -m yum -a "name=git state=absent"




user management
===============
The 'user' module allows easy creation and manipulation of existing user accounts, as well as removal of user accounts that may exist:


ansible atlanta -m user -a "name=user2 password=password@123"



Delete a user

ansible all -m user -a "name=foo state=absent"
