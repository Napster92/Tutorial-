Jenkins best practice


1: Every code checkin should have automatic build process.

2: Project pipeline must work

3: Bug fixing at the early stage after any build failure

4: Continous feedback to developer on the project build status -  Failure & static code analysis

5: Copy artificate of each build porcess -- Maintain jar file of each build. -- Post build action - geneating artificate.

6: Default location of each jenkins jobs inside   .jenkins/workspace/ProjectFolderName

7: deploying project on the Tomcat server or docker container on successfull build for QA

8: Each build having set of Junit test case and fuctional test cases which sould be passed 

9: we are using Groovy script for project pipline.

node {
    stage "Create build output"
    
    // Make the output directory.
    sh "mkdir -p output"

    // Write an useful file, which is needed to be archived.
    writeFile file: "output/usefulfile.txt", text: "This file is useful, need to archive it."

    // Write an useless file, which is not needed to be archived.
    writeFile file: "output/uselessfile.md", text: "This file is useless, no need to archive it."

    stage "Archive build output"
    
    // Archive the build output artifacts.
    archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'output/*.txt', excludes: 'output/*.md'
}
